In this project, we created different models to predict handwritten digits. We used a dataset available in the Scikit-learn Python library called `load_digits()`. The dataset has 1,797 images. Initially, we created a model using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. Then, we built different models using Artificial Neural Networks.

The conclusion was that the different models reached similar scores, but K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) with k=1 had a slightly better performance, reaching 99% accuracy.
